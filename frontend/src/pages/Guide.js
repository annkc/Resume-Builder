            <h3><br></br>How to Print a Resume</h3>
            <p>You've created your resume and have found it from the list. Now what?</p>
            <p>When you're viewing a resume, the button at the bottom of the page opens a new tab
                where the inputs you provided are formatted as they would be in a proper resume.
                You can print this out via your browser. <Link to={'/resume-print/sample'} target='_blank'>Here's an example.</Link></p>
            <p>To find the option to print in your browser, use the shortcut Ctrl + P, or 
                âŒ˜ Command + P for iOS, which may bring it up in your browser. If not, it can be 
                found in your browser's settings.</p>
            <p>Before clicking the print button, select the printer option that would save/print as 
                a PDF, and for the other options, be sure to not include the background graphics or 
                the header/footers. Feel free to also adjust the margins to your preferences.</p>

            <h3><br></br>Now you're all set!</h3>
